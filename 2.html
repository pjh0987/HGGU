    <p>
        <h2>Maintenance</h2>
        Since forks are safety products, the highest attention should be paid to a regular inpection.
        <h3>Inspection Period</h3>
        According to ISO5057, fork arms in service shall be inspected at intervals of not more than 12 months 
        <br>and whenever any defect or permanent deformation is detected. Severe applications may require more frequent inspections as follows:
        <br>For operations up to 8 hours one day = at least 12 months
        <br>For operations up to 16 hours one day = at least 6 months
        <br>For operations up to 24 hours one day = at least 3 months
        <h3>Inspection Person</h3>
        The yearly inspection shall be carried out carefully only by trained personnel. For professional advice, you could just contact us freely, 
        <br>we will have our experienced engineer who tells you whether or how a fork could be paired.
        <h3>Inspection Method</h3>
        Forks should be inspected with special fork kit, which could be purchased domestically or contact us for help. 
        <br>ISO 5057 stipulates that forks need to be replaced when worn 10 %. The reason is that a 10 % reduction in thickness will result in a 20 % loss in fork capacity. 
        <br>An inspection, repair or exchange of forks shall only be carried out by pair.
    </p>
